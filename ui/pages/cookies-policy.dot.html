        <p class="paragraph">
            A cookie is a small data file, often including a unique identifier, which is sent to your computer, mobile
            phone or
            tablet device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so the website can remember some
            information
            about your browsing activity on the website. The cookie will collect information relating to your use of our
            Services,
            information about your device, e.g. the device’s IP address and browser type, broad location and, if you
            arrived at our
            site via a link from third party site, the URL of the linking page. If you have registered for any Services
            or you are a
            subscriber, it may also collect your name and email address, which may be transferred to data processors for
            registered

        <p class="paragraph">
            Similar technologies known as “local storage” may also be used in our Services as an alternative to cookies.
            This is
            technology which is similar to cookies and performs very similar functions, such as caching data to enable
            us to improve
            our Services, allowing you to register for our Services, tracking activity to enable us and our advertisers
            to advertise
            to you in accordance with this policy and counting the number of people who view adverts on our Services.
            Where we refer
            to “cookies” in this policy, we mean cookies or similar technologies.

            Cookies record information about your online preferences and help us to tailor our Services to your
            interests.
            Information provided by cookies can help us to analyse your use of our Services and help us to provide you
            with a better
            user experience.

            In addition to cookies, our Services may also use web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs. These are
            all types

        <p class="paragraph">
            Persistent cookies are saved on your device for a fixed period of time after the browser has closed and are
            used where
            we (or a third party) need to identify you for a later browsing session. The fixed period of time is

            days for targeting or behavioural advertising cookies and may be up to 26 months for analytical performance
            and
            measurement cookies;

        <h3 class="title">What are cookies used for?</h3>
        <h4 class="uk-margin-remove">1. Functional Cookies</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Functional cookies are essential to the running of our Services. They are used to remember your preferences
            on our
            websites and to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information collected by these cookies is
            usually
            anonymised, so we cannot identify you personally. Functional cookies do not track your internet usage or
            gather
            information which could be used for selling advertising, but they do help with serving advertising. These
            cookies are
            usually session cookies which will expire when you close your browsing session.
        </p>
        <h4 class="uk-margin-remove">2. Essential or ‘Strictly Necessary’ Cookies</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
            These cookies are essential for the running of our Services. Without these cookies, parts of our websites
            would not
            function. These cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do remember preferences beyond
            your current

            usually
            session cookies which will expire when you close your browsing session.

        <h4 class="uk-margin-remove">3. Analytical Performance and Measurement Cookies</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Analytical performance cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Services, for example, to
            determine the number
            of pageviews and the number of unique users a website has. Web analytics services may be designed and
            operated by third
            parties. The information provided by these cookies allows us to analyse patterns of user behaviour and we
            use that
            information to enhance user experience or identify areas of the website which may require maintenance. The
            information
            is anonymous (i.e. it cannot be used to identify you and does not contain personal information such as your
            name and

        <p class="paragraph">
            We use these cookies to measure users’ behaviour to better develop our Services. By using analytics services
            provided by

        <ul>
            <li>
                manage online advertising and revenue share arrangements. Our approved advertising partners, primarily
                Google
                (Doubleclick, AdX, AdSense), Rubicon Project, Index Exchange, AppNexus, OpenX, Pubmatic, Criteo and
                GroupM use cookies
                together with web beacons to provide advertising to you and to enable us to manage our relationship with
                those
                advertisers by, for example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement or
                followed a link in
                an advertisement;
            </li>
            <li>
                manage eCommerce activities via affiliate links and associated revenue share arrangements;
            </li>
            <li>
                measure general user behaviour across our sites and third party sites to build a profile based on users
                browsing
                patterns so that we and third parties can target advertising to users that will be more relevant to
                users’ interests.
                This means that if, for example, users visit a page with a review about a particular camera then the
                cookie will collect
                this information and we may target adverts for that camera to those users and, if users visit third
                party sites that are
                part of the same advertising network, those third parties may target adverts for that camera to those
                users;
            </li>
            <li>
                to create profiles that trusted third parties can buy to allow them to better target their advertising
                with more
                relevant content; and
            </li>
            <li>
                keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page of one of our
                websites, analyse
                the effectiveness of our ads, and provide auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.

        <p class="paragraph">
            You may notice on some pages of our websites that cookies have been set that are not related to Future. When
            you visit a
            page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these third party service providers may
            set their own
            cookies on your device. Future does not control the use of these third party cookies and cannot access them
            due to the

            Some of our websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to users. Adobe utilise their
            own cookies,
            which are not manageable through your browser settings but are used by the Flash Player for similar
            purposes, such as
            storing preferences or tracking users. Flash Cookies work in a different way to web browser cookies; rather
            than having
            individual cookies for particular jobs, a website is restricted to storing all data in one cookie. You can
            control how
            much data, if any, may be stored in that cookie but you cannot choose what type of information is allowed to
            be stored.

            We also include web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns. This means that
            if you open
            an email from us we can see which of the pages of our Website you have visited. Our web beacons do not store
            additional

            Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their device a little intrusive, in particular
            when the

            which is
